Room with Statues
/////
this is where i woke up........ i don't... i don't... remember anything.
Looking around this cold room, the only thing i can see is that light coming
from the from that door with the window.looking around this room the only thing
i can see are those 4 statues
it seems they are looking at me.
Around me i can see 4 doors, i clearly see thst one of those doors have a small window.

DiningRoom
/////
looking around the room i can see a table , on the walls there are some paintings,
it seems that those paitings are looking at me nothing unusual,

ControlRoom
/////
first look at this room everything seem alright,there is nothing useful here, 
even if under a desk i can see an old safe hidden, i wonder what is inside that safe.
but i guess it requires a number to opend it.
Ther are no other exits, the only door in this room is the one iused.

is the floor, i can see that there some marks all around a squared shape.
